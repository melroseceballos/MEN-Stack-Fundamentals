Ideally this is something you are able to include in your Project 1 portfolio and can show off to recruiters, hiring managaers, and other engineers.


## Background
After your pokedex commissions, you've started to get more requests from various clients! Currently, you have been commissioned to create an e-commerce store for a company. They need you to build a website and database that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and leave reviews.

You will implement this site using Express, Mongoose, EJS, and CSS or SASS.


## Submission Instructions
- Fork and clone this repository
- In the repository folder on your computer, create a folder called `express-store`.
- Scaffold a MEN-stack app inside the `express-store` folder. You'll be working in this folder for each of the three parts.
- Commit early and commit often
- When you have finished a part create a commit message like this:
    ```
    Part 1 complete - ready to be graded
    ```
- We will be grading each part as it's own deliverable! Make sure you complete each part before moving on to the next


## General Requirements (applicable to all parts)
- Implement EJS partials for resuable elements such as a navigation menu, or a footer.
- Ensure each page of your website is reponsive to the screen it is displayed on.
- Follow MVC architecture and observe a separation of concerns.
- Maintain consistent CSS styling throughout the site. Using a CSS framework may be beneficial for this.
- Provide a link to any resources from which you obtained code, and be able to explain the purpose of all the code within your application.


## Part 1 - Index, Show, and Seed Routes
### Planning
- Create a route table that explains lays out the REST, HTTP, and CRUD actions of each route in your application.
- Wireframe each page.
- Create a `README` inside the `express-store` folder that contains your route table and wireframes.

### Set Up
- Create all the folders and files you will need.
- Set up you MongoDB connection and Mongoose schema.
    - Your `product` schema must include the following properties.
        1. Name
        1. Description
        1. Rating
        1. Price
        1. Quantity
    - You are welcome to add any additional properties that you would like to this schema.
- Create your seed data.


### Index Route
- Create the landing page of the website that displays all the products in the store.
- Each product will link to its own details page (show route)


### Show Route
- Create a reusable page that dynamically renders all the information about a product.
- If a product has a `0` value in the `quantity` field, display text that says **OUT OF STOCK**

    ![Out of Stock](./out_of_stock.png)

    - **HINT**: Look up conditional rendering in EJS using `if..else` statements or ternary operators

- Must contain a link back to the index route.


### Seed Route
- Create a route that will eliminate all the products in your database and then re-populate it with your seed data.


### Bonus
- Include a search bar on the index route that will allow users to search for items
- Create an additional route for an `About` page.
- Organize products by category. Create logic that will allow users to naviagte to specific routes that display only products in a given category.
